            <h2>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</h2>
            <p>HTML is the Webâ€™s core language for creating content for everyone to use anywhere. The World Wide Web's
                markup language has always been HTML.</p>
            <p>HTML was originally designed as a language for semantically describing scientific documents, but its
                general design and adaptations over the years have enabled it to be used to describe a number of other
                types of documents.</p>

            <h2>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</h2>
            <p>Style sheets describe how documents are presented on screens, in print, or perhaps how they are
                pronounced. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet mechanism that has been specifically developed
                to meet the needs of Web designers and users.</p>

            <h2>JavaScript</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
                objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
            <p>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
                Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements
                on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</p>
